# Snake Game - JavaScript


Welcome to the classic Snake Game built with JavaScript! In this game, you control a snake that moves around the grid to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to collect as many points as possible before the snake collides with the boundary or itself.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
2. The snake will continuously move in the direction you specify.
3. Guide the snake to eat the food (represented by üçé) that randomly appears on the grid.
4. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer, and your score will increase.
5. Be careful not to let the snake collide with the boundary or itself, as this will end the game.
